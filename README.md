# 1Blocker custom 'hide elements' rules
---

[1Blocker](https://1blocker.com) is a content blocker that I use for Safari on MacOS and iOS. It has a feature that allows users to create custom rules that hide page elements based on CSS selectors. This repository contains the hide element rules I use to clean up a few popular websites.

To use them, open 1Blocker, click the "Custom" tab, then "CSS Hide Elements." Next, click "+ New Rule," name the rule, and paste in the css selectors. Finaly, turn off the option to "hide on all sites" and type in the corresponding root domain for the site.
